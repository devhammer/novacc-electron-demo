# novacc-electron-demo
Demo Repo for Electron Demo at Northern Virginia Code Camp Fall 2016

## Prerequisites
- Install NodeJS and NPM

- Install Electron Prebuilt
  ```shell
  npm install electron-prebuilt -g
  ```

To run the demos, clone the repository, and switch to the branches in order.

I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing. 

With VS Code installed, open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo, and then type:

   ```shell
   code .
   ```

With Electron Prebuilt installed, you can run any of the demos by switching to the target branch, and running:

   ```shell
   electron index.js
   ```
