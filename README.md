# novacc-electron-demo
Demo Repo for Electron Demo at Northern Virginia Code Camp Fall 2016

## Prerequisites
- Install NodeJS and NPM

- Install Electron Prebuilt
  ```shell
  npm install electron-prebuilt -g
  ```

To run the demos, clone the repository, and check out the branches in order (you may need to use git fetch to grab the branches before you can check them out):

 - 1-Start
 - 2-AddIndexFiles
 - 3-HelloWorld
 - 4-NewWindow
 - 5-ContextMenu
 - 6-Screenshot

I recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for editing. 

With VS Code installed, open a command prompt and navigate to the folder where you cloned the repo, and then type:

   ```shell
   code .
   ```

With Electron Prebuilt installed, you can run any of the demos by switching to the target branch, and running:

   ```shell
   electron index.js
   ```
